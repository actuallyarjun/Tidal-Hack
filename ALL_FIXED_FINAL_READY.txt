================================================================

STEP 1: RESTART THE APP
  - Stop current instance (Ctrl+C in terminal)
  - Run: RUN_THIS.bat
  - Wait for browser to open

STEP 2: LISTEN FOR STARTUP
  You should HEAR:
    "Vision Navigation Assistant ready..."
  
  If you don't hear anything:
    - Check speaker volume!
    - Check sidebar: TTS: Enabled âœ“
    - If shows Disabled, something's wrong

STEP 3: START LIVE STREAM
  - Select "Live Webcam Stream"
  - Click START button
  
  You should HEAR:
    "Live stream active. Real-time detection running."
  
  And SEE:
    ðŸŸ¢ Stream active - Real-time detection running

STEP 4: TEST VOICE RECOGNITION
  - Scroll to "ðŸŽ¤ Voice Commands"
  - Click "ðŸŽ¤ PRESS TO SPEAK"
  
  You should HEAR:
    "Listening"
  
  In TERMINAL you should SEE:
    [AUDIO] Opening microphone...
    [AUDIO] Listening... (timeout: 5s)
    [AUDIO] SPEAK NOW!
  
  Now SPEAK LOUDLY: "What do you see?"
  
  In TERMINAL you should SEE:
    [AUDIO] Audio captured!
    [AUDIO] Sending to Google Speech API...
    [AUDIO] SUCCESS! Recognized: 'what do you see'
  
  You should HEAR:
    "You said: what do you see"
  
  Then HEAR:
    "Thinking"
