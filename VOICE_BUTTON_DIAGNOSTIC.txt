        VOICE BUTTON NOT WORKING - DIAGNOSTICS
================================================================

IMPORTANT: The ScriptRunContext warnings are NORMAL - ignore them!
The real issue is the voice button not responding.

================================================================
              STEP-BY-STEP DIAGNOSIS
================================================================

STEP 1: Test Speech Recognition Independently
----------------------------------------------
Run this FIRST to test if speech recognition works at all:

  python test_speech.py

EXPECTED OUTPUT (Good):
  [OK] PyAudio is installed
  [OK] Found X audio devices
  [OK] SpeechRecognition is installed
  [OK] Microphone initialized
  [OK] Calibration complete
  
  Then it will ask you to speak.
  
  SUCCESS! Recognized: 'your words'

IF IT FAILS:
  - Shows [NO] for PyAudio ‚Üí pip install pyaudio
  - Shows [NO] for SpeechRecognition ‚Üí pip install SpeechRecognition
  - Timeout ‚Üí Speak louder/clearer
  - API error ‚Üí Check internet connection

================================================================

STEP 2: Check App Initialization
---------------------------------
Run the app and look at SIDEBAR:

  RUN_THIS.bat

In the sidebar under "üìä System Info":
  **Speech:** Enabled ‚úì  ‚Üê GOOD!
  **Speech:** Disabled ‚úó  ‚Üê BAD!

If it shows "Disabled ‚úó":
  - Speech recognizer didn't initialize
  - Check terminal for [AUDIO] error messages
  - PyAudio probably missing or broken

If it shows warning:
  "‚ö†Ô∏è Voice commands unavailable"
  ‚Üí Run: pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition
  ‚Üí Restart app

================================================================

STEP 3: Test Voice Button with Enhanced Feedback
-------------------------------------------------
With app running:

1. Scroll to "üí¨ Ask the AI Assistant" section

2. Click "üé§ Voice" button

3. Look for IMMEDIATE feedback in BROWSER:
   
   GOOD (Speech available):
     "üé§ Listening... Speak now!"
     "(Check terminal for [AUDIO] messages)"
   
   BAD (Speech not available):
     "‚ùå Speech recognition not available"
     "üí° Install: pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition"

4. If you see "Listening...", check TERMINAL:
   Should show:
     [AUDIO] Listening...

5. Speak: "What do you see?"

6. Check TERMINAL for:
     [AUDIO] Recognizing...
     [AUDIO] Recognized: what do you see

7. Check BROWSER for:
     "‚úÖ Heard: what do you see"
     Then AI response appears

================================================================

STEP 4: Troubleshoot Based on Results
--------------------------------------

SCENARIO A: Sidebar shows "Speech: Disabled ‚úó"
SOLUTION:
  1. Stop app (Ctrl+C)
  2. Run: pip install pyaudio SpeechRecognition
  3. Run test: python test_speech.py
  4. If test passes, restart app
  5. Sidebar should now show "Enabled ‚úì"

SCENARIO B: Button shows "Speech recognition not available"
SOLUTION:
  Same as Scenario A - packages not installed

SCENARIO C: Button shows "Listening..." but nothing happens
TERMINAL shows: [AUDIO] Listening... (but nothing after)
SOLUTION:
  - You're not speaking or speaking too quietly
  - Timeout is 5 seconds, speak within that time
  - Check microphone is working (try Windows Voice Recorder)
  - Reduce background noise

SCENARIO D: "[AUDIO] Listening timeout"
SOLUTION:
  - Speak sooner after clicking button
  - Speak louder
  - Move closer to microphone
  - Check microphone isn't muted

SCENARIO E: "[AUDIO] Could not understand audio"
SOLUTION:
  - Speak more clearly
  - Reduce background noise
  - Try simple phrases: "hello", "test"
  - Check microphone quality

SCENARIO F: "[AUDIO] Recognition service error"
SOLUTION:
  - Check internet connection
  - Google Speech API might be temporarily down
  - Wait a minute and try again
  - Check if firewall is blocking

================================================================

CURRENT STATUS CHECK
====================

Based on previous messages, let's diagnose:

WHAT WE KNOW:
  ‚úì PyAudio is installed (we installed it)
  ‚úì SpeechRecognition should be installed
  ‚úì App runs and loads
  ‚úì Live stream works
  ? Voice button clicked but doesn't work
  ? ScriptRunContext errors (normal, ignore)

MOST LIKELY CAUSES:

1. CACHE ISSUE - Old code cached
   FIX: 
   - Stop app (Ctrl+C)
   - Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
   - Delete .streamlit folder if it exists
   - Restart: RUN_THIS.bat

2. INITIALIZATION FAILED - Speech recognizer didn't init
   FIX:
   - Run: python test_speech.py
   - If it fails, reinstall packages
   - If it passes, restart app

3. MICROPHONE PERMISSION - Windows blocking access
   FIX:
   - Windows Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
   - Allow apps to access microphone
   - Allow Python to access microphone
   - Restart app

4. ANOTHER APP USING MIC - Conflict
   FIX:
   - Close other apps (Zoom, Discord, etc.)
   - Close browser tabs using microphone
   - Restart app

================================================================

DETAILED TEST PROCEDURE
========================

DO THIS NOW:
-----------

1. STOP the app if running (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. RUN test script:
   python test_speech.py
   
   Expected: Should recognize your speech
   If fails: Fix packages first!

3. CHECK packages explicitly:
   python -c "import pyaudio; print('PyAudio OK')"
   python -c "import speech_recognition; print('SpeechRecognition OK')"
   
   Both should print OK

4. RESTART app:
   RUN_THIS.bat

5. CHECK sidebar when app loads:
   Look for: **Speech:** Enabled ‚úì
   
   If shows Disabled:
     ‚Üí Speech recognizer failed to initialize
     ‚Üí Check terminal for [AUDIO] errors
     ‚Üí Likely PyAudio issue

6. CLICK voice button:
   Should immediately show "üé§ Listening..."
   
   If shows error instead:
     ‚Üí Speech not available
     ‚Üí Go back to step 2

7. SPEAK when listening:
   Say: "hello world"
   
   Check terminal for:
     [AUDIO] Recognizing...
     [AUDIO] Recognized: hello world
   
   Check browser for:
     "‚úÖ Heard: hello world"

================================================================
